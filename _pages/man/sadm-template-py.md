## What you need to know to use the SADMIN tools library
The Python script template ($SADMIN/bin/sadm_template.py) is ready to use and it include everything to use the SADMIN python library.
Run the template and take a look at the code. 
As an example, we will create create a new script from that template and show you what are the benefits of using it.
{: .text-justify}


## Another 'Hello World' example
First, make a copy of the template Python script, into the user ($SADMIN/usr/bin) directory.
```bash
$ cp $SADMIN/bin/sadm_template.py $SADMIN/usr/bin/helloWorld.py
```

You should **never modify the original template**, always make a copy and then use the copy.
The Python template supplied with SADMIN, could get updated by a newer version of SADMIN.
The **user directory ($SADMIN/usr) is your directory** and will never be updated by future version.

 With the editor of your choice, add the line below in the function called 'main_process()'.  
```st.writelog ("Hello World")```   

![sadm_template_py_01.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_01.png "SADMIN Section of the template"){: .align-center}


One of the function included in the SADMIN Python module is "**st.writelog()**".
By default, it write the string it received to the screen and to the script log.
If you want to write the message to the log only, you can modify the variable "**st.log_type**".   
```st.log_type = 'B'             # Output goes to [S]creen [L]ogFile [B]oth```   

Let's run our script now and see the output we get.
![sadm_template_py_06.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_06.png "SADMIN Section of the template"){: .align-center}

We can divide the output of the screen in three section. We have the *Header*, the 
*script execution output* and finally the script *Footer*. Let's explore each of these sections.


## The Script Header
- The script header is part of the '**st.start()**' function included in the SADMIN module. It's 
  function is to initialize the script log, generate the script header (if needed), create or update the 
  Result Code History file (.rch) and some attributes settings. After executing the '**st.start()**' 
  function, the SADMIN tools are ready to use.  
- The script header is generated by default when the call to the '**st.start()**' function included in SADMIN Python module.
  - Unless you set the attribute '**st.log_header**' to 'False' in the SADMIN Section, the script header will be generated.   
    ```st.log_header = True           # Show/Generate Header in script log (.log) ```   
- The second line of the header show the script name, version number and the SADMIN module version.
  - You set your script version number in the SADMIN Section of the script.   
    ```st.ver = "2.1"                 # Current Script Version```   
  - The version of the SADMIN Python module is available as a read only attribute called "**st.libver**".
- The third one, show the fully qualified system name (FQDN) and the system type (LINUX,AIX,DARWIN)
- The fourth line show the distribution name, it's version number and code name.
- The last line is a separator line that signal the end of the header and the beginning of the script output.

## The Script Footer
- By default, every script using SADMIN library will show the script footer.    
  - The footer is generated, unless you set the attribute '**st.log_footer**' to 'False' in 
the SADMIN Section of the script.  
  ```st.log_footer = True           # Show/Generate Footer in script log```  
- The first line of the footer is a separator line that signal the end of the script and the beginning of the footer.
- The second line show the exit code of the script (0=Success 1=Error).
- The third one, show the execution elapse time (HH:MM:SS).
- Next we have the name of the [R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory file and the maximum of lines to keep in it.
  - The default maximum number of lines to keep in a RCH file is taken from the SADMIN 
configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).   
    ```SADM_MAX_RCHLINE=125```   
  - You can override this value in your script, by changing the value of the attribute shown below.   
    ```st.cfg_max_rchline  = 125      # When Script End Trim rch file to 125 Lines```    
- The next line inform you if a notification (alert) will be send or not.
- The log file name is one the next line along with the maximum of lines to keep in it.
  - The default maximum number of lines to keep in the log file is taken from the SADMIN 
configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).   
    ```SADM_MAX_LOGLINE=2000```   
  - You can override this value in your script by changing the value of the attribute shown below.   
    ```st.cfg_max_logline  = 1000     # When Script End Trim log file to 1000 Lines```  
- The last two lines indicate the execution ending date and time and a line consisting of 
eighty equal sign '='.


## A [R]esult [C]ode [H]istory file was created
- Every time you run a script that's using the SADMIN Tools, by default there is a RCH file 
created or updated.
- The **RCH file are created in the SADMIN data directory '$SADMIN/dat/rch'**.
- The RCH file name is prefix by the hostname, followed by the script name and have an extension 
of '.rch'. In our example, we are on a host named 'holmes', the script name is 'helloWorld', so 
the RCH file name is 'holmes_helloWorld.rch'. 
- The SADMIN server collect every '*.rch' files that changed from every SADMIN client every 
5 minutes (via a rsync). Information included in this file will be visible from the Web interface 
and from the command line. It is also be used to trigger an alert, if it were requested.
- If you created an interactive script and you don't care about the exit code, you can disable 
usage of the RCH file.
  - In this situation, set attribute '**st.use_rch**' to 'False' in the SADMIN Section of the script.   
    ```st.use_rch = False             # Generate entry in Result Code History (.rch)```   
  - The default maximum number of lines to keep in the '.rch' file is taken from the SADMIN 
configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).   
    ```SADM_MAX_RCHLINE=125```   
  - You can override this default by changing '**st.cfg_max_rchline**' attribute in the SADMIN 
Section of your script.
    ```st.cfg_max_rchline  = 125      # When Script End Trim rch file to 125 Lines```   
  - By default the RCH file is trim at the end of each execution (Unless 'st.use_rch' is set to 'False').

**Example of a [R]esult [C]ode [H]istory file**   
![rch_file_format.png](/assets/img/files/rch_file_format.png "SADMIN rch_file_format"){: .align-center}




## A log file was created
- Every time a script run that's using the SADMIN Tools, there's a log file created or updated.
- **Log are created in the $SADMIN/log directory**.
- The log file name is prefix by the host name, followed by the script name and '.log' extension.
  - In our example, we are on a host named 'imac', the script name is 'helloWorld', so the log 
name is 'imac_helloWorld.log'.
- The SADMIN server collect every updated log files from every SADMIN client every 5 minutes 
(via a rsync in sadm_fetch_clients.sh).
- A script log can be cumulative or a new one can be created at each execution. The default in 
the template is set to create a new log file at each execution.
- If you want your script log to be cumulative, then set '**st.log.append = True**'.   
    ```st.log_append = False    #   Append Existing Log```    
- At the end of each execution, the log file is trim to the number of line specified in 
$SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg by the variable 'SADM_MAX_LOGLINE'.
  - You can override this default by changing '**st.cfg_max_logline**' attribute value in the 
SADMIN Section of your script.   
    ```st.cfg_max_logline  = 1000     # When Script End Trim log file to 1000 Lines```    

**Example of the log file**

## Log and RCH file viewed from the Web interface

**Web view of our helloWorld script**
![sadm_template_py_10.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_10.png "SADMIN Script Web view"){: .align-center}  


**Example of viewing a RCH file from the web interface**

**Example of a script log from the web interface**
![sadm_template_py_18.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_18.png "SADMIN Log Web view"){: .align-center}  


**Viewing all your servers scripts results on the terminal**  
This option is only available on the SADMIN server.  
![sadm_rch_scr_summary_01.png](/assets/img/cmdline/sadm_rch_scr_summary_01.png "SADMIN View RCH on command line"){: .align-center}  



## Suppressing the script Header and Footer
To suppress header/footer from log and screen, change "st.log_footer" and "st.log_header" attribute to 'False'.
![sadm_template_py_22.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_22.png "Suppress Header & Footer"){: .align-center}  

We can see now the header and footer doesn't appear anymore on the screen and in the log of the script.
![sadm_template_py_26.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_26.png "No more Header and Footer"){: .align-center}  



## Create a script from scratch that use SADMIN Tools
To create a Python script using the SADMIN tools you need to include these requirements in your code :
- The 'setup_admin()' function should appear at the beginning of your script, as in the template $SADMIN/bin/sadm_template.py.  

```
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SADMIN section - Setup for Global Variables and import SADMIN Python module
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
def setup_sadmin():

  # Load SADMIN Standard Python Library Module ($SADMIN/lib/sadmlib_std.py).
  try :
      SADM = os.environ.get('SADMIN')                      # Getting SADMIN Root Dir.
      sys.path.insert(0,os.path.join(SADM,'lib'))          # Add SADMIN to sys.path
      import sadmlib_std as sadm                           # Import SADMIN Python Libr.
  except ImportError as e:                                 # If Error importing SADMIN 
      print ("Error Importing SADMIN Module: %s " % e)     # Advise User of Error
      sys.exit(1)                                          # Go Back to O/S with Error
  
  st = sadm.sadmtools()                                    # Create SADMIN instance             

  # You can use variable below BUT DON'T CHANGE THEM - They are used by SADMIN Module.
  st.pn               = os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])      # Script name with extension
  st.inst             = os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]).split('.')[0] # Name without Ext
  st.tpid             = str(os.getpid())                   # Get Current Process ID.
  st.exit_code        = 0                                  # Script Exit Code (Use it)
  st.hostname         = socket.gethostname().split('.')[0] # Get current hostname

  # CHANGE THESE VARIABLES TO YOUR NEEDS - They influence execution of SADMIN Module.
  st.ver              = "2.1"        # Current Script Version
  st.log_type         = 'B'          # Output goes to [S]creen to [L]ogFile or [B]oth
  st.log_append       = False        # Append Existing Log(True) or Create New One(False)
  st.log_header       = True         # Show/Generate Header in script log (.log)
  st.log_footer       = True         # Show/Generate Footer in script log (.log)
  st.multiple_exec    = "N"          # Allow running multiple copy at same time ?
  st.use_rch          = True         # Generate entry in Result Code History (.rch) 
  st.debug            = 0            # Increase Verbose from 0 to 9 
  st.usedb            = True         # Open/Use Database(True) or Don't Need DB(False)
  st.dbsilent         = False        # When DB Error, False=ShowErrMsg and True=NoErrMsg 
                                     # But Error Code always returned (0=ok else error)

  # Override Default define in $SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg
  #st.cfg_alert_type   = 1           # 0=NoMail 1=OnlyOnError 2=OnlyOnSuccess 3=Allways
  #st.cfg_alert_group  = "default"   # Valid Alert Group are defined in alert_group.cfg
  #st.cfg_mail_addr    = ""          # This Override Default Email Address in sadmin.cfg
  #st.cfg_cie_name     = ""          # This Override Company Name specify in sadmin.cfg
  #st.cfg_max_logline  = 500         # When Script End Trim log file to 500 Lines
  #st.cfg_max_rchline  = 35          # When Script End Trim rch file to 35 Lines
  #st.ssh_cmd = "%s -qnp %s " % (st.ssh,st.cfg_ssh_port) # SSH Command to Access Server 

 # Start SADMIN Tools - Initialize 
  st.start()                         # Init. SADMIN Env. (Create dir.,Log,RCH, Open DB..)
  return(st)                         # Return Instance Object To Caller
``` 

- It create an instance of the sadmtools() class under the name 'st' ([S]admin [T]ools).

```
st = setup_sadmin()                         # Setup Var. & Load SADM Lib
```

The setup_admin() function also call the SADMIN 'sadm_start()' module/function, to initialize the environment.


```
# Start SADMIN Tools - Initialize 
st.start()                                  # Create dir. if needed, Open Log, Update RCH file..
return(st)                                  # Return Instance Obj. To Caller
```


## Summary of what is done by the 'st.start()' function
- Verification and creation of the SADMIN directory structure.
- It create or append the script log (Depending on value you put in variable 'st.log_append = True').
- The starting date and time is written to the Result Code History file (See 'st.use_rch = True').
- Create the PID file, if only one copy of your script should run simultaneously ('st.multiple_exec = "N"').
- The script header is written to the log by default (see 'st.log_header = True').
- It create 3 unique temporaries files that are available to your script (st.tmp_file1, st.tmp_file2, st.tmp_file3).

You may want to modify some of the fields **before** the call is made to the start function (st.start()).
- You may want to change the version number of your script ('st.ver').
- Do you want a single copy of your script running at the same time ('st.multiple_exec') ?
- If you plan to use the server database, ensure that the field 'st.usedb' is set to True (Available only on SADMIN server)
- If you use the server Database, the 'st.dbsilent' field control what happen when an error occur :
  - Either set to 'False' or 'True', when an error occur the error number will be returned to caller.
  - Additionally, if 'st.silent' is set to False, an error message will be shown (No message when set to 'True').


## Summary of what is done by the 'st.stop()' function
- The 'st.stop(st.exit_code)' function need to be called at the end of the script (See example below).  
![sadm_template_py_30.png](/assets/img/sadm_template_py_30.png "Stop function"){: .align-center}  
- If the server database was used (st.usedb=True), the connection to server database will be closed.
