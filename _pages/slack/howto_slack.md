## Setup Textbelt in SADMIN configuration file

* Now that we have our 'Textbelt' key, we need to record it in the SADMIN configuration file.  
* Using your favorite editor open ‘$SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg’ and update the two Textbelt fields.  

{% highlight bash %}
# vi $SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEXTBELT SMS TEXT MESSAGE VARIABLE
# This is the key generated by TextBelt and the URL to use the SMS Service
# Go to https://textbelt.com/ and press the 'Generate my key' button.
# Enter your email address and decide what is the right plan for you.
# It's $10 for 250 Text Messages, $20 for 600, $40 for 1200.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SADM_TEXTBELT_KEY = 12b0f573dfc4e1377471dc930684dfbcdded045eiSw1swtuyrUyRxHTJX2vAFhdxs
SADM_TEXTBELT_URL = https://textbelt.com/text
{% endhighlight %} 

 
**SADM_TEXTBELT_KEY:**  
This field contain the textbelt key that was previously generated for you.  
To eliminate any typo error, use the clipboard copy/paste to enter the key.  
  
**SADM_TEXTBELT_URL:**  
It's the URL use by SADMIN to send the SMS request to Textbelt web site.  
SADMIN is using the ‘curl’ linux command to issue the request to textbelt.  


## Defining cellular number and sms alert group  
  
**Cellular group definition**

* You need to declare what are the cellular number that can receive SADMIN alert.  
* In column one, we give the cellular number a name, it can be the cellular owner name or cellular purpose (like support,on_call,...).  
* On the definition line, we need to have the name, the cellular group type ('c') and finally the telephone number.  

**SMS/Texto group definition**  

* If you need to alert more than one person (cellular) when an alert is issue, you can use the SMS/Texto group to do so.  
* You declare the SMS/Texto group, like 'webteam', 'telecom', 'sysadmin', that include multiple cellular definition.  
* In the example below, the SMS/Texto group 'emergency', will send the alert to four cellulars.  

With your favorite editor open ‘alert-group’ file and define your own cellular and SMS/Texto group.  

`# vi $SADMIN/cfg/alert_group.cfg   `

![image-center](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_web_part4.png){: .align-center}

## Setting the default alerting group

* When an alert is issue from a script or from the SADMIM System Monitor, it's sent to an alert group.
* The 'default' alert group name used is the one specified in the SADMIN configuration file (See image below).
* The 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP' name doesn't have to be 'default', it could be any of the group define in the alert group file.
* You can change the 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP' name with your favorite editor whenever you need to.
* The group name you specify, MUST exist in the Alert Group file ($SADMIN/cfg/alert_group.cfg).
* You may also leave it to 'default' and change the definition of the 'default' group in the alert group file.

<br>

## Changing the default alerting group

* Let's say, SMS (Texto) is your preferred way to get alerted
  * We must make sure the 'default' alert group have a type 't' (texto). 
  * We have chosen to send alert to the 'sysadmin_sms' SMS alert group. 
  * All alert will now be sent by default to group 'sysadmin_sms' that contain one cellular definition 'john_doe'.  
  * We will see later on, how to override this default within your script and in the system monitor.
  * Remember, group name must begin in column one, be unique and shouldn't contain any space.

With your favorite editor open the alert group file.   

`# vi $SADMIN/cfg/alert_group.cfg`   

{% highlight bash %}
# Default Alert Group (It should not be changed or deleted).
# 1st column : Group Name : 'default' 
# 2nd column : Group Type : [s]=SlackChannel [m]=Email [c]=Cell.Number [t]=TextoGroup

{% endhighlight %}



## Override the default alert group and type in a script

    Here, we assume that you have created your script based on our Shell script template or Python template.
    To override 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP' and/or 'SADM_ALERT_TYPE' default value, remove the '#' and change it to the value of your choice.
    Remember that the alert group name you assign to 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP' variable, must be define in the alert group file.
    We have an override example, later on this page.
    These lines are located in the SADMIN section near the top of the script.

    Shell Script (See sadm_template.sh) :
            #export SADM_ALERT_TYPE=1            # 0=None 1=AlertOnErr 2=AlertOnOK 3=Allways
            #export SADM_ALERT_GROUP="default"   # AlertGroup define in alert_group.cfg
            
    Python Script (See sadm_template.py) :
            #inst.cfg_alert_type  = 1            # 0=None 1=AlertOnErr 2=AlertOnOK 3=Allways
            #inst.cfg_alert_group = "default"    # AlertGroup define in alert_group.cfg
            
     
    The script default alert type
        The alert type is only use at the end of the script, to determine whether or not we send an an alert.
        The default alert type is set at installation time and is set to '1' by default.
        You can view that actual value by looking in the SADMIN configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).
        When you run a Python or a Shell script using the SADMIN Tools, it use this default value.

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/default_alert_type_in_sadmincfg.png)  

        The Alert type have four possible values :
            0 Means that you don't want any alert to be send, either if the script finish with success or failure.
            1 You want to send an alert only if the script finish with an error (Exit code not equal to 0).
            2 An alert will be send only when the script finish with success (Exit code = 0).
            3 Always send an alert, whether the script terminate with failure or success.


## Override the default alert group in SADMIN System Monitor

    The alert group used by the SADMIN System Monitor are specify in the configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/hostname.smon).
    If none are specified, the 'default' alert group is use.
    The alert group is specified near the end of each configuration lines.
    The columns are labelled as column J for Warning and column K for Error.
    If the Alert group used in SysMon configuration don't exist in the alert group file, the group 'default' is use.

    Here is an example to check filesystem space usage in SysMon configuration file (hostname.smon). 

```
       #Column
    #  1        2  3  4  5   6   7    8  9 A B C D E F G    H       I     J          K              L
    FS/opt     49 >= 85 90 000 0000 0000 Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y 00000000 0000 default sysadmin_sms sadm_fs_incr.sh
```


In the example above ;

    If the filesystem /opt percentage usage become greater or equal to 85%, a warning alert will be send to 'default' alert group.
    If the filesystem /opt percentage usage become greater or equal to 90%, an error alert will be send to 'sysadmin_sms' alert group.
    Note, that if a script ('sadm_fs_incr.sh') is specified in the last column of a filesystem check line, the script is executed.
    The script is executed when the warning level is reach (here, if the filesystem usage is greater or equal to 85%).
    If the filesystem is a LVM created in a volume group that have more that 10% free, the filesystem is increase by 10% (Max. 2 time a day).
    The last column can contain a script name (placed in $SADMIN/usr/bin), nothing or a '-' (place holder).

## Testing SMS/Texto alert
Let's make a copy of the shell template script to create our test script.
Let's begin by typing the following command to create our test script name 'sadm_test_alert.sh' ;

    # cd $SADMIN/usr/bin
    /sadmin/usr/bin # cp $SADMIN/bin/sadm_template.sh sadm_test_alert.sh
    /sadmin/usr/bin # nano sadm_test_alert.sh
    
Before we change anything

    Let's see what we have by default, for our global alert variables in our script.
    The 'SADM_ALERT_TYPE' variable is set to '1', this means that alert will be send only when the script terminate with error.
    The alert group that would get alerted is 'default', as define by the content of global variable 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP'.
    We will change these variables later on.

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step1_initial_script.png)  

The 'default' Alert Group is currently set to send email to 'linternux@gmail.com'.  

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step2_initial_alertgroup.png)  

Also in our alert group file, we have the following group define, we'll use the 'sms_sysadmin' group in our test.  

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step3_initial_alertgroup.png)  

Let's execute our test script before we make any change to it, to see what the output look like.  
We can see that it run without error '(Script return code is 0') and that it ran in 4 seconds.  
That it 'Requested alert only if script fail' and that it 'Won't send alert', since the script terminate with success.  
Everything seem normal, so let's modify our script to test the SMS/Texto alerting system.  

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step4_initial_execution.png)  


**Making change to test SMS/Texto alert**  


    Let's change the script and simulate an error, so an alert is send.
    /sadmin/usr/bin # nano sadm_test_alert.sh
    We will add a line that make 'SADM_EXIT_CODE' equal to '1', to provoke an error.

    First change : Original code  
![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step5_initial_script.png)  


First change : Modified code   
![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step6_change_script.png)  

Let's see what we have by default, for our global alert variables in our script.  
The 'SADM_ALERT_TYPE' variable is set to '1', this means that alert will be send only when the script terminate with error.  
We will leave the 'SADM_ALERT_TYPE' variable like it is.  
The alert group that would get alerted is 'default', as define by the content of global variable 'SADM_ALERT_GROUP'.  
For our test, we would like to send the alert (if any) to the 'sms_sysadmin' alert group, so let's change that.  


Second change : Original code  
![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step7_initial_script.png)   

Second change : Modified code  
![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step8_change_script.png)    

### Running our test script

We are now ready to execute our test script and see if we receive this alert.

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step9_change_execution.png)    


Alert that we received on our cellular  

![BrokenImage](/assets/img/slack/textbelt_step10_sms_receive.png)    

        Note:
        It can take a few seconds up to 4-5 minutes to receive the alert.
        This is due to the fact that SADMIN collect clients info every 5 minutes.
        This is something that will be enhance in the future version. 


We hope you have a better understanding of how the alarm system work in SADMIN.
We could have done the same test using the Python template ($SADMIN/bin/sadm_template.py) script.
