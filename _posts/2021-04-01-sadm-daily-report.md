This script produce web reports of the last 24 hrs activities and email them to the sysadmin. 
It run automatically early every morning from the SADMIN server crontab (/etc/cron.d/sadm_server), 
but you can also be run it manually when desired. It can only be run on the SADMIN server.

$ sudo $SADMIN/bin/sadm_daily_report.sh [-v] [-h] [-b] [-r] [-s] [-d 0-9]  
{% endhighlight %}


## Description
The script produce three reports, each of them is sent to the email(s) defined by the field '*SADM_MAIL_ADDR*' in the SADMIN configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg). It can only be run on the SADMIN server (Not on a SADMIN client). The reports are also accessible via the web interface.

If the package '[wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)' is present on the SADMIN server (It should have been installed by the setup process), a PDF version of each report is also attached to the email.

If one of the three report is not desired, you can use the '-r', '-b' or the '-s' command line switch to disable the desired report (email). Note that only the actives systems will appear on these reports.  

### The scripts report:
![Daily Script Report Example](/assets/img/man/sadm_daily_report_script.png){: .align-center}
  - The running scripts are listed first, then the scripts that terminated with an error and finally all the scripts grouped by system. So it give you view of the statistics of each script (start time, end time, elapse time,...) of each systems sorted and grouped by name. When something look different than the normal, like the alert group used is different than the default group or the last execution date of a script is more than thirty days, it will be shown with a yellow background.

  - You can also view the log of each script just by clicking on the script name. 
  - The same report is also accessible in the heading of any of the "Scripts Status" web pages.

![Daily Backup Report Example](/assets/img/man/sadm_daily_report_backup.png){: .align-center}
  - This report present the last execution statistics of all the daily backup script (sadm_backup.sh) for each systems. Since the daily backup should have been taken during the night, they should all have the same execution date.

```bash
# Exclude template scripts and demo scripts.
SCRIPTS="sadm_template sadmlib_std_demo"
    
# Exclude System Startup/Shutdown Script for Daily scripts report
SCRIPTS="$SCRIPTS sadm_startup sadm_shutdown"
