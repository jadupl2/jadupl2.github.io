## The Script Header
- The script header is part of the '**st.start()**' function included in the SADMIN module. It's 
  function is to initialize the script log, generate the script header (if needed), create or update the 
  Result Code History file (.rch) and some attributes settings. After executing the '**st.start()**' 
  function, the SADMIN tools are ready to use.  
- The script header is generated by default when the call to the '**st.start()**' function included in SADMIN Python module.
  - Unless you set the attribute '**st.log_header**' to 'False' in the SADMIN Section, the script header will be generated.   
    ```st.log_header = True           # Show/Generate Header in script log (.log) ```   
- The second line of the header show the script name, version number and the SADMIN module version.
  - You set your script version number in the SADMIN Section of the script.   
    ```st.ver = "2.1"                 # Current Script Version```   
  - The version of the SADMIN Python module is available as a read only attribute called "**st.libver**".
- The third one, show the fully qualified system name (FQDN) and the system type (LINUX,AIX,DARWIN)
- The fourth line show the distribution name, it's version number and code name.
- The last line is a separator line that signal the end of the header and the beginning of the script output.

## The Script Footer
- By default, every script using SADMIN library will show the script footer.    
  - The footer is generated, unless you set the attribute '**st.log_footer**' to 'False' in 
the SADMIN Section of the script.  
  ```st.log_footer = True           # Show/Generate Footer in script log```  
- The first line of the footer is a separator line that signal the end of the script and the beginning of the footer.
- The second line show the exit code of the script (0=Success 1=Error).
- The third one, show the execution elapse time (HH:MM:SS).
- Next we have the name of the [R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory file and the maximum of lines to keep in it.
  - The default maximum number of lines to keep in a RCH file is taken from the SADMIN 
configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).   
    ```SADM_MAX_RCHLINE=125```   
  - You can override this value in your script, by changing the value of the attribute shown below.   
    ```st.cfg_max_rchline  = 125      # When Script End Trim rch file to 125 Lines```    
- The next line inform you if a notification (alert) will be send or not.
- The log file name is one the next line along with the maximum of lines to keep in it.
  - The default maximum number of lines to keep in the log file is taken from the SADMIN 
configuration file ($SADMIN/cfg/sadmin.cfg).   
    ```SADM_MAX_LOGLINE=2000```   
  - You can override this value in your script by changing the value of the attribute shown below.   
    ```st.cfg_max_logline  = 1000     # When Script End Trim log file to 1000 Lines```  
- The last two lines indicate the execution ending date and time and a line consisting of 
eighty equal sign '='.
